# Cost Sheet Consolidation Public
 A sanitized (for company privacy) version of a project done for Gennaro Inc. The purpose of this project was to collect legacy data that was stored in hundreds (perhaps thousands) of hand keyed excel sheets across shared folder. The data was read in, stripped of any bad information, error handled to deal with human typos and then spat back out into an excel file in which we could then access it easily, or upload it into our newer systems. 

 This file is likely unable to be run by anyone outside of Gennaro however, it at least shows off object oriented design, error handling, and effective time complexity on a large data set in python.
